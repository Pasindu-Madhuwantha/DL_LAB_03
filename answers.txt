1D convolution is a technique used in image processing to identify edges, which indicate abrupt 
changes in color or intensity. By sliding a specialized filter, or kernel, along rows of an image, 
we can highlight regions of significant change.The Sobel kernel, for instance, detects both horizontal 
and vertical changes.The process involves multiplying pixel values and summing them to create a new image,
emphasizing potential edges. Applying a threshold to this output image turns it into a binary edge map.
In some cases, edge visibility can be enhanced by using edge strengths to adjust the original image. 
In essence,1D convolution helps unveil edges by pinpointing areas of abrupt transition in images.

If we increase the number of epochs, validation error can rise because of overfitting. 
Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too specific to the training data noise.
It fits the training data perfectly but struggles with unseen data. 
So, longer training can lead to validation error going up, as the model loses its generalization ability.




Mini batch SGD converges faster compared to batch gradient descent due to its balance between stability and 
randomness. Instead of using the whole dataset, mini batch SGD divides it into smaller parts, 
making updates more frequent and efficient. 
This speeds up learning and prevents the optimization process from getting stuck. Additionally, 
mini batch processing can utilize parallel computing for faster computation.
